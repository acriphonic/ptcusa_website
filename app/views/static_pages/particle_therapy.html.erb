  	<h5>Particle Therapy</h5>
	<p>Pyramid's products are used in several critical parts of commercial particle therapy systems. Particle therapy is fast emerging as a premier method of treating various cancers which are difficult or even impossible to treat by other methods. A dedicated particle accelerator, such as a cyclotron or synchrotron, accelerates ions such as protons or carbon nucleii to energies sufficient to penetrate the body. The particles are delivered to the patients in treatment stations using precision ion optics. The energy and spatial distribution of the particle beam at each station must be controlled to high accuracy, so that the tumor is irradiated while the dose to surrounding tissues is minimized. Because the majority of the energy deposition by a particle beam occurs in the Bragg peak at the end of range, the dose can be delivered to a tumor inside the body, but with much lower dose to the surface layers that can be achieved by conventional X-ray radiotherapy.</p>
	<p>Illustrated above are pencil beam scanning components that Pyramid is supplying to the <a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/radiationoncology/burrprotoncenter.aspx">Francis H Burr Proton Therapy Center</a> at Massachusetts General Hospital to enhance the treatment and research capabilites of their fixed beamline treatment room.  The equipment includes ionization chambers for real-time beam tracking, scanning magnet system, power amplifiers, beam position monitor, beam path and an integrated signal measurement and control electronics suite. The room also allows automated switching to double scattering mode, and thus provides a unique facility.</p>
